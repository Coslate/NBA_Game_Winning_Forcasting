content = Kevin Norwood Bacon[1] (born July 8, 1958)[2] is an American actor and musician. His films include musical-drama film Footloose (1984), the controversial historical conspiracy legal thriller JFK (1991), the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992), the historical docudrama Apollo 13 (1995), and the mystery drama Mystic River (2003). Bacon is also known for taking on darker roles such as that of a sadistic guard in Sleepers (1996) and troubled former child abuser in a critically acclaimed performance in The Woodsman (2004). He is equally prolific on television, having starred in the Fox drama series The Following (2013–2015). For the HBO original film Taking Chance (2009), Bacon won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, also receiving a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. The Guardian named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.[3] In 2003, Bacon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry.[4]Bacon has become an icon for the concept of interconnectedness (as in social networks), having been popularized by the game 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'. In 2007, he created SixDegrees.org, a charitable foundation.[5]Bacon, the youngest of six children, was born and raised in a close-knit family in Philadelphia.[2] His mother, Ruth Hilda (née Holmes; 1916–1991), taught at an elementary school and was a liberal activist,[2] while his father, Edmund Norwood Bacon (May 2, 1910 – October 14, 2005), was a well-respected architect and a prominent Philadelphian who was Executive Director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission for many years.[6]At age 16, in 1975, Bacon won a full scholarship to and attended the Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts at Bucknell University,[7] a state-funded five-week arts program at which he studied theater under Dr. Glory Van Scott.  The experience solidified Bacon's passion for the arts.[5][6]Bacon left home at age 17 to pursue a theater career in New York City, where he appeared in a production at the Circle in the Square Theater School. 'I wanted life, man, the real thing', he later recalled to Nancy Mills of Cosmopolitan. 'The message I got was 'The arts are it. Business is the devil's work. Art and creative expression are next to godliness.' Combine that with an immense ego and you wind up with an actor.'[8] Bacon's debut in the fraternity comedy National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) did not lead to the fame he had sought, and Bacon returned to waiting tables and auditioning for small roles in theater.[6] He briefly worked on the television soap operas Search for Tomorrow (1979) and Guiding Light (1980–81) in New York.In 1980, he had a prominent role in the slasher film Friday the 13th.[9] Some of his early stage work included Getting Out, performed at New York's Phoenix Theater, and Flux, at Second Stage Theatre during their 1981–1982 season.[10]In 1982, he won an Obie Award for his role in Forty Deuce,[11] and soon afterward he made his Broadway debut in Slab Boys, with then-unknowns Sean Penn and Val Kilmer. However, it was not until he portrayed Timothy Fenwick that same year in Barry Levinson's film Diner – costarring Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Tim Daly, and Ellen Barkin – that he made an indelible impression on film critics and moviegoers alike.[12]Bolstered by the attention garnered by his performance in Diner, Bacon starred in the box-office smash Footloose (1984).[10] Richard Corliss of TIME likened Footloose to the James Dean classic Rebel Without a Cause and the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musicals, commenting that the film includes 'motifs on book burning, mid-life crisis, AWOL parents, fatal car crashes, drug enforcement, and Bible Belt vigilantism.'[13] To prepare for the role, Bacon enrolled at a high school as a transfer student named 'Ren McCormick' and studied teenagers before leaving in the middle of the day.[6][14] Bacon earned strong reviews for Footloose,[15] and he appeared on the cover of People magazine soon after its release.Bacon's critical and box office success led to a period of typecasting in roles similar to the two he portrayed in Diner and Footloose, and he had difficulty shaking this on-screen image. For the next several years he chose films that cast him against either type and experienced, by his own estimation, a career slump.In 1988, he starred in John Hughes' comedy She's Having a Baby,[10] and the following year he was in another comedy called The Big Picture.[16]In 1990, Bacon had two successful roles. He played a character who saved his town from under-the-earth 'graboid' monsters in the comedy/horror film Tremors,[17] and he portrayed an earnest medical student experimenting with death in Joel Schumacher's Flatliners.[10]In Bacon's next project he starred opposite Elizabeth Perkins in He Said, She Said. Despite lukewarm reviews and low audience turnout, He Said, She Said was illuminating for Bacon. Required to play a character with sexist attitudes, he admitted that the role was not that large a stretch for him.[10]By 1991, Bacon began to give up the idea of playing leading men in big-budget films and to remake himself as a character actor. 'The only way I was going to be able to work on 'A' projects with really 'A' directors was if I wasn't the guy who was starring', he confided to The New York Times writer Trip Gabriel. 'You can't afford to set up a $40 million movie if you don't have your star.'[18] He performed that year as gay prostitute Willie O'Keefe in Oliver Stone's JFK[19] and went on to play a prosecuting attorney in the military courtroom drama A Few Good Men.[20] Later that year he returned to the theater to play in Spike Heels, directed by Michael Greif.[10]In 1994, Bacon earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role in The River Wild,[10] opposite Meryl Streep. He described the film to Chase in Cosmopolitan as a 'grueling shoot', in which 'every one of us fell out of the boat at one point or another and had to be saved'.His next film, Murder in the First, earned him the Broadcast Film Critic's Association Award in 1995,[10] the same year that he starred in the blockbuster hit Apollo 13.[21] Bacon played a trademark dark role once again in Sleepers (1996).[22] This part starkly contrasted with his appearance in the lighthearted romantic comedy, Picture Perfect (1997).[10]Bacon made his debut as a director with the television film Losing Chase (1996), which was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, and won one.[23] Bacon again resurrected his oddball mystique that year as a mentally-challenged houseguest in Digging to China[10] and as a disc jockey corrupted by payola in Telling Lies in America.[10] As the executive producer of Wild Things (1998), Bacon reserved a supporting role for himself and went on to star in Stir of Echoes (1999), directed by David Koepp.[24]In 2000, he appeared in Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man.[25] Bacon, Colin Firth and Rachel Blanchard depict a ménage à trois in their film, Where the Truth Lies.[26] Bacon and director Atom Egoyan have condemned the MPAA ratings board decision to rate the film 'NC-17' rather than the preferable 'R'. Bacon commented: 'I don't get it, when I see films (that) are extremely violent, extremely objectionable sometimes in terms of the roles that women play, slide by with an R, no problem, because the people happen to have more of their clothes on.'[27]In 2003 he acted with Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in Clint Eastwood's movie Mystic River.Bacon was again acclaimed for a dark starring role playing an offending pedophile on parole in The Woodsman (2004), for which he was nominated for best actor and received the Independent Spirit Award.[28] He appeared in the HBO Films production of Taking Chance, based on an eponymous story written by Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl, an American Desert Storm war veteran.[29] The film premiered on HBO on February 21, 2009. Bacon won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie for his role.On July 15, 2010, it was confirmed that Bacon would appear in Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class.[30] His character was mutant villain Sebastian Shaw.[31]In March 2012, Bacon was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, 8 – a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage – as Attorney Charles J. Cooper.[32] The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.[33][34]From 2013 to 2015, Bacon starred as Ryan Hardy in the FOX television series The Following.[35] In 2013, he won a Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television for that role.[36]In 2015, he said in a Huffington Post interview[37] and several magazines reported he would like to return to the Tremors franchise.[citation needed] However, Bacon doesn't appear in Tremors 5: Bloodline (2015).Beginning in 2012, Bacon has appeared in a major advertising campaign for the EE mobile network in the United Kingdom, based on the Six Degrees concept and his various film roles.[38][39] In 2015, he became a commercial spokesperson for the U.S. egg industry.[40]Bacon has been married to actress Kyra Sedgwick since September 4, 1988; they met on the set of the PBS version of Lanford Wilson's play Lemon Sky. He has said: 'The time I was hitting what I considered to be bottom was also the time I met my wife, our kids were born, good things were happening. And I was able to keep supporting myself; that always gave me strength.'[8] Bacon and Sedgwick have starred together in Pyrates, Murder in the First, The Woodsman, and Loverboy. They have two children, Travis Sedgwick (b. 1989) and Sosie Ruth (b. 1992). The family resides on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.[41] Bacon was previously in a five-year relationship with actress Tracy Pollan, in the 1980s.[42]Bacon has spoken out for the separation of church and state,[43][44] and told The Times in 2005 that he did not 'believe in God.'[45] However, he has also said that he is not anti-religion.[46]Bacon and Sedgwick appeared in will.i.am's video 'It's a New Day', which was released following Barack Obama's 2008 presidential win. The pair lost part of their savings in the Ponzi scheme of infamous swindler Bernard Madoff.[47][48]Bacon and Sedgwick learned in 2011, via their appearance on the PBS TV show Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, that they are ninth cousins, once removed.[49] They also appeared in a video[50] promoting the 'Bill of Reproductive Rights', supporting among other things a woman's right to choose and have access to birth control.[51]Bacon is the subject of the trivia game titled Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, based on the idea that, due to his prolific screen career covering a diverse range of genres, any Hollywood actor can be linked to another in a handful of steps based on their association with Bacon. The name of the game derives from the idea of six degrees of separation. Although he was initially dismayed by the game, the meme stuck, and Bacon eventually embraced it, forming the charitable initiative SixDegrees.org, a social networking site intended to link people and charities to each other.[52]The measure of proximity to Bacon has been mathematically formalized as the Bacon number and can be referenced at websites including Oracle of Bacon, which is in turn based upon Internet Movie Database data. In 2012 Google added a feature to their search engine, whereby searching for an actor's name followed by the words 'Bacon Number' will show the ways in which that actor is connected to Kevin Bacon.[53] This feature is no longer active.A similar measurement exists in the mathematics community, where one measures how far one is removed from co-writing a mathematical paper with the famous mathematician Paul Erdős. This is done by means of the Erdős number, which is 0 for Paul Erdős himself, 1 for someone who co-wrote an article with him, 2 for someone who co-wrote with someone who co-wrote with him, etc. People have combined the Bacon number and the Erdős number to form the Erdős–Bacon number, which is the sum of the two.[54]Kevin formed a band called The Bacon Brothers with his brother, Michael. The duo have released six albums.[55]

content = Loverboy is a 2005 American drama film directed by Kevin Bacon and the cast includes his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, as well as both of their children, Travis and Sosie. Thus far, it is the only film credit for both the children, though Sosie Bacon would later appear on the television show The Closer.Most of the story is told in flashbacks from the opening scene to Emily's childhood and adult life.The movie opens with Emily (Kyra Sedgwick) singing to her 6-year-old son in a car while attempting to teach him the hand positions on a car steering wheel. During this time the scene keeps cutting back and forth to Emily packing a child’s suitcase. In the car she tells him that they are about to leave on a journey to an amazing land.The scene changes and travels to eight and a half years earlier, during which Emily narrates her story on how she conceived her son Paul. She believed that she had only one purpose, to bring life to this earth. After unsuccessful artificial inseminations, she set out seeking numerous sexual encounters with random men all over the country. She theorized that multiple men meant no father, and she wanted it that way. However, after 10 weeks of pregnancy, she begins to bleed at an airport, losing her child and her hope of ever having a baby. Retreating into a state of depression she takes sanctuary at a hotel during a business seminar, where she meets a man named Paul (Campbell Scott). They immediately connect and have a passionate night which results in Emily’s second pregnancy.She buys a house and gives birth to a boy, whom she named Paul, after his father. She spends every waking moment with Paul, reading books to him and searching for buried treasure. She playfully nicknames him Loverboy and he calls her Miss Darling. As he gets older he sees other children going to school and he questions Emily why he was not going too. She tries to keep him away from other children as the means to protect him but as the days go by he becomes increasingly difficult as he attempts to get to school and have fun. When she finally succumbs to his requests and lets him go to school, she begins to experience separation anxiety; she constantly tries to pull him out of school and Paul, not appreciating this, runs away. When the staff tries to calm Emily, she breaks down stating that her child is exceptional and school is diminishing his potential.Back in opening scene in the car, Paul loses his first tooth and Emily makes him sleep in the car, after which she takes a bottle of pills and falls asleep with the car engine running. Emily had blocked the garage door with rags as an attempt to suffocate her and Paul believing that this was the only way they could be forever together.In the morning the boy who mows the lawn finds Paul and he survives. Emily, however, does not.In the end, Paul is older and in a field with his girlfriend whispering into the ears of the sheep just as he and his mother used to do.

content = Dartmouth College (/ˈdɑːrtməθ/ DART-məth) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is the ninth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7] Although founded as a school to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, Dartmouth primarily trained Congregationalist ministers throughout its early history. The university gradually secularized, and by the turn of the 20th century rose from relative obscurity into national prominence as one of the top centers of higher education.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14]Following a liberal arts curriculum, the university provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 57 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[15] Dartmouth comprises five constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[16] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, the Rockefeller Institute for Public Policy, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,400, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions is highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of 8.7% for the Class of 2022.[17]Situated on a hill above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[18] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[19] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, strong Greek culture, and wide array of enduring campus traditions.[20][21][22] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I.Dartmouth is consistently included among the highest-ranked universities in the United States by several institutional rankings,[23] and has been cited as a leading university for undergraduate teaching and research by U.S. News & World Report.[24][25] In 2018, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education listed Dartmouth as the only 'majority-undergraduate,' 'arts-and-sciences focused,' 'doctoral university' in the country that has 'some graduate coexistence' and 'very high research activity.'[26] In a New York Times corporate study, Dartmouth graduates were shown to be among the most sought-after and valued in the world.[27]The university has produced many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives,[28] 24 U.S. governors, 10 billionaire alumni,[29] 10 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 79 Rhodes Scholars,[30] 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients,[31] 13 Pulitzer Prize winners, and numerous MacArthur Genius fellows,[32] Fulbright Scholars,[33] CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 corporations, high-ranking U.S. diplomats, scholars in academia, literary and media figures, professional athletes, and Olympic medalists.Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister from Columbia, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.[8]Wheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.[34] The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by Dr. John Phillips in 1762, who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.[8] The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the College. That charter created a college 'for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others.' The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth—an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it—Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.[9] The College granted its first degrees in 1771.[10]Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.[8][35] Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.[8][35]In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college'  charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[8] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: 'It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.'[8]In 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.[37]Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[11] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[38] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having 'refounded Dartmouth' and bringing it into national prestige.[39] Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[11] In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university.[40][41] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[11][42] During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.[43]In 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth.[44] Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[45] At about the same time, the college adopted its 'Dartmouth Plan' of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[44] In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from 'Men of Dartmouth' to 'Dear old Dartmouth'.[46]During the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.[11][47] The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008.[48][49] The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.[50] In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance 'whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial,' citing Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.[12]Since the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict.[51] President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008[52] and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009.[53]In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).[54]Dartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book Passion for Skiing as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book Passion for Snow.[55]Dartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students.[7][56] The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.[57] For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history.[58] The Government Department, whose prominent professors include Stephen Brooks, Richard Ned Lebow, and William Wohlforth, was ranked the top solely undergraduate political science program in the world by researchers at the London School of Economics in 2003.[59] The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew Samwick, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world.[60]In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.[61] Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten 'distributive requirements' in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.[61] Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in 'independent, sustained work,' culminating in the production of a thesis.[61] In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.[62][63]Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s.[7] Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of 'Dartmouth University';[7] however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward), the school uses the name 'Dartmouth College' to refer to the entire institution.[8]Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities.[7] Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.[64]Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern University, Tufts University and the University of Vermont.[65]USNWR graduate school rankings[74]USNWR departmental rankings[74]Dartmouth was ranked 11th among undergraduate programs at national universities by U.S. News & World Report in its 2018 rankings. Dartmouth's strength in undergraduate education is highlighted by U.S. News when in 2009 through 2013 it ranked Dartmouth first in undergraduate teaching at national universities. It was ranked 2nd in this area in the 2018 rankings. The institution also ranked 5th in High School Counselor Rankings in 2018. The college ranks 7th in The Wall Street Journal's ranking of top feeder schools.[75]The 2017 Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked Dartmouth among the 71-99th best universities in the nation, alongside institution such as Georgetown University and University of Notre Dame.[76] AWRU ranks Dartmouth among the 76–100 best schools in the world for Business Administration and 101–150 for Management and Psychology.In Forbes' 2016 rankings of colleges, Dartmouth ranked 17th overall in the combined liberal arts college and national universities ranking and 2nd in 'grateful graduates', with a financial grade of A+.[77]The 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only 'majority-undergraduate', 'arts-and-sciences focus[ed]', 'research university' in the country that also had 'some graduate coexistence' and 'very high research activity.'[78][79][80]For its graduate programs, U.S. News ranks Dartmouth's MBA program 9th overall and 6th for management. Among its other highly ranked graduate offerings, the school is ranked 40th in computer science, 29th in medicine for primary care, and 37th in medicine for research. Its global ranking places is at 242nd.[81]Undergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and U.S. News & World Report as 'most selective.'[85][86] The Princeton Review, in its 2018 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 98 out of 99.[87]For the freshman class entering Fall 2018, Dartmouth received 22,033 applications of which 1,925 were accepted for an 8.7% admissions rate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, a record 46.3% were valedictorian or salutatorian, with 97% ranking in the top decile of their class. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1497, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33. More than 51% identified as being students of color, 15% are among the first generation in their families to matriculate to college, 11% are international students, and 9% are legacies.[17]Additionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85.[82] Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, with the exception of internationals, on a need-blind basis.[88]Dartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth practices need-blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. For international students, financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $100,000 or less and possessing typical assets. In 2015, $88.8 million in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply 'D-Plan') is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[89] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman, senior, or sophomore summer terms.[90]  During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[89] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[91]The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as 'a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds.'[11] Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president (ex officio), the state governor (ex officio), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called 'charter trustees'), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board ('alumni trustees').[92] The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.Although the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,[93] the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.[94] In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.[95][96] In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.[97]—U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953[98]Dartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its 269-acre (1.09 km2) campus is centered on a 5-acre (2 ha) 'Green',[99] a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771.[100] Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,[101] and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.[102] In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500 acres (18 km2) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains[103] and a 27,000-acre (110 km2) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.[104]Dartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.[105][106] Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style,[107][108][109] a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.[110] The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.[111][112]A notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms.[113][114]The college's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts ('the Hop'). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.[115] The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.[116] Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.[115] The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes ('Hinman boxes')[117] and the Courtyard Café dining facility.[118] The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,[119] and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.[120]In addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus[121] and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.[122] The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School.[123] The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.[122] The Thayer School comprises two buildings;[122] Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.[124] The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library.[124]Dartmouth's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs.[7][125] Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business & Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Kresge Physical Sciences Library, Paddock Music Library, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002).[126] Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's 200-foot (61 m) tower is an iconic symbol of the College.[127][128][129]Dartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century.[100] Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.[130] The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a state of the art fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track.[131] Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.[132] Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.[133] The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.[134] Also visible from Memorial Field is the 91,800-square-foot (8,530 m2) Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.Dartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),[135] and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.[136] The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a 100-acre (0.40 km2) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire,[137] that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.Beginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities.[138] Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges.[139] The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.[139] Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.[140] More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.[139]Campus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus.[141] Four of them are located at the center of campus in the Class of 1953 Commons, formerly Thayer Dining Hall.[142]The Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the 'student union' or 'campus center.'[143] It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Centre.[144][145] Robinson Hall, next door to both Collis and Thayer, contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the Dartmouth Outing Club and The Dartmouth daily newspaper.[146]Lord Hall, Allen HouseMorton Hall, East Wheelock HouseWoodward Hall, North Park HouseMid Massachusetts Hall, School HouseTopliff Hall, South HouseRussell Sage Hall, West HouseCutter-Shabazz House for Intellectual InquiryIn 2006, The Princeton Review ranked Dartmouth third in its 'Quality of Life' category, and sixth for having the 'Happiest Students.'[147] Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities.[20] In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports.[148] The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in 'The Princeton Review' in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.[149]In 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in 'total of reports of rape' on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape. The Washington Post attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.[150] In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth College had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a 'sexually violent or harassing manner,' compared to 45.5% of students nationally.Dartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[151][152]Dartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.[153] In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 'issue-oriented' groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.[154] Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club,[155] which includes the nationally recognized[156] Big Green Bus; the campus's oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review;[157] and The Dartmouth, arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.[158] The Dartmouth describes itself as 'America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799.'[158]Partially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.[20][159] Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations.[160] In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization;[161] since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.[162] Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s.[163] In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become 'substantially coeducational';[164] this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.[165] The fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[151][152]Dartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.[166]The college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.[167]Approximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics.[168] In 2007, Dartmouth College fielded 34 intercollegiate varsity teams: 16 for men, 16 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).[169] As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.[169][170] In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.[7]The college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.[7][171] The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014.[172] The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2015.[173] The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008.[174] In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a 50-yard (46 m) swim and three terms of physical education.[175]It is often pointed out that the charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Eleazar Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created 'for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others.'[176] However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate White youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education.  The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.[177]The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years.[177] In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a 'new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment.'[177] Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.[177]Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.[178] The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as 'big weekends'[179][180] or 'party weekends'.[181] In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.[182] Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges.[183][184] In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.[185]The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance.[186] The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.[187]Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run Dartmouth Outing Club trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge.[188] In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is Vox clamantis in deserto. The Latin motto is literally translated as 'A calling voice in the wilderness',[189][190] but is more often rendered as 'A voice crying out in the wilderness'.[1] The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.[190][191] Richard Hovey's 'Men of Dartmouth' was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,[182] and became the school's official song in 1926.[192] The song was retitled to 'Alma Mater' in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.[193]Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas.[176] The college's founder Eleazar Wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.[190] Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words 'vox clamantis in deserto' the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.[194]On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.[190] The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from '1770' to '1769', to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of '1769' to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.[190] The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.[195]On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a 'Dartmouth College Shield' for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from '1770' to '1769' around 1958.[190] That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.[195]College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.[196] The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of Dartmouth Medical School, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.[197] The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.Dartmouth has never had an official mascot.[198] The nickname 'The Big Green,'[199] originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green ('Dartmouth Green') as the school's official color in 1866.[200][201] Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname 'the Indians', a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.[198] This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the 'use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education.'[202] Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, The Dartmouth Review, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,[203] but never succeeded in doing so.[204]Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become 'official.' One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,[205] the mascot has received approval from only the student government.[206] In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the 'Dartmoose' as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.[207]Dartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the college.[208] Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in The Wall Street Journal based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.[209]By 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students and has over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields.[210]Nelson A. Rockefeller, 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York, graduated cum laude from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930. Over 164 Dartmouth graduates have served in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives,[211] such as Massachusetts statesman Daniel Webster.[211] Cabinet members of American presidents include Attorney General Amos T. Akerman,[212] Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich,[213] former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, and former Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. C. Everett Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States under President Ronald Reagan.[214] Two Dartmouth alumni have served as justices on the Supreme Court of the United States: Salmon P. Chase and Levi Woodbury.[215][216] Eugene Norman Veasey (class of 1954) served as the Chief Justice of Delaware. The 46th and current Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf,[217] and the 42nd and current Governor of Illinois, businessman Bruce Rauner,[218] are also Dartmouth alumni.In literature and journalism, Dartmouth has produced thirteen Pulitzer Prize winners: Thomas M. Burton,[219] Richard Eberhart,[220] Dan Fagin,[221] Paul Gigot, Frank Gilroy, Jake Hooker,[222] Nigel Jaquiss,[223] Joseph Rago,[224] Martin J. Sherwin,[225] David K. Shipler,[226] David Shribman, and Justin Harvey Smith.Other authors and media personalities include ABC Senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper, novelist and founding editor of The Believer Heidi Julavits, 'Dean of rock critics' Robert Christgau, National Book Award winners Louise Erdrich and Phil Klay, novelist/screenwriter Budd Schulberg,[227] political analyst Dinesh D'Souza,[228] radio talk show host Laura Ingraham,[229] commentator Mort Kondracke,[230] and journalist James Panero.[231] Norman Maclean, a former professor at the University of Chicago[232] and author of A River Runs Through It and Other Stories, graduated from Dartmouth in 1924.[233] Theodor Geisel, better known as children's author Dr. Seuss, was a member of the class of 1925.[234]In the area of religion and theology, Dartmouth alumni include priests and ministers Ebenezer Porter, Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, Caleb Sprague Henry, Arthur Whipple Jenks, Solomon Spalding, and Joseph Tracy; and rabbis Marshall Meyer, Arnold Resnicoff, and David E. Stern.[235][236][237][238][239] Hyrum Smith, brother of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, attended the college in his teens. He was Patriarch of the LDS Church.Dartmouth alumni in academia include Stuart Kauffman and Jeffrey Weeks, both recipients of MacArthur Fellowships (commonly called 'genius grants').[240][241] Dartmouth has also graduated three Nobel Prize winners: Owen Chamberlain (Physics, 1959),[242] K. Barry Sharpless (Chemistry, 2001),[243] and George Davis Snell (Physiology or Medicine, 1980).[244] Educators include founder and first president of Bates College, Oren Burbank Cheney (1839),[245] the current chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, Marye Anne Fox (PhD. in Chemistry, 1974),[246] founding president of Vassar College Milo Parker Jewett,[247] founder and first president of Kenyon College Philander Chase,[248] first professor of Wabash College Caleb Mills,[249] and former president of Union College Charles Augustus Aiken.[250][251] Nine of Dartmouth's 17 presidents were alumni of the College.[252]Dartmouth alumni serving as CEOs or company presidents and executives include Charles Alfred Pillsbury, founder of the Pillsbury Company and patriarch of the Pillsbury family, Sandy Alderson (San Diego Padres),[253] John Donahoe (eBay), Louis V.

Immelt (General Electric),[257] Gail Koziara Boudreaux (United Health Care),[258] Grant Tinker (NBC),[259] and Brian Goldner (Hasbro).[260]In film, entertainment, and television, Dartmouth is represented by Budd Schulberg, Academy Award-winning screenwriter of On the Waterfront, Michael Phillips, who won the Academy Award for best picture as co-producer of The Sting, Rachel Dratch, a cast member of Saturday Night Live,[261] Shonda Rhimes creator of Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice and Scandal,[262] Chris Meledandri Executive Producer of Ice Age, Horton Hears a Who!, and Despicable Me,[261] and the title character of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Fred Rogers.[263] Other notable film and television figures include Sarah Wayne Callies (Prison Break),[264] Emmy Award winner Michael Moriarty,[261] Andrew Shue of Melrose Place,[265] Aisha Tyler of Friends and 24,[261] Connie Britton of Spin City, The West Wing and Friday Night Lights, Mindy Kaling of The Office and The Mindy Project,[261] and David Harbour of Stranger Things.A number of Dartmouth alumni have found success in professional sports. In baseball, Dartmouth alumni include All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner and manager Brad Ausmus,[266] All-Star reliever Mike Remlinger,[267] and pitcher Kyle Hendricks. Professional football players include former Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler,[268] linebacker Reggie Williams,[269][270] three-time Pro Bowler Nick Lowery,[271] quarterback Jeff Kemp,[272] and Tennessee Titans tight end Casey Cramer, plus Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Matt Burke.[273] Dartmouth has also produced a number of Olympic competitors. Adam Nelson won the silver medal in the shot put in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics to go along with his gold medal in the 2005 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki.[274] Kristin King and Sarah Parsons were members of the United States' 2006 bronze medal-winning ice hockey team.[275][276] Cherie Piper, Gillian Apps, and Katie Weatherston were among Canada's ice hockey gold medalists in 2006.[277][278][279]Dick Durrance and Tim Caldwell competed for the United States in skiing in the 1936 and 1976 Winter Olympics, respectively.[280][281] Arthur Shaw,[282] Earl Thomson,[283] Edwin Myers,[282] Marc Wright,[282] Adam Nelson,[274] Gerry Ashworth,[282] and Vilhjálmur Einarsson[282] have all won medals in track and field events. Former heavyweight rower Dominic Seiterle is a member of the Canadian national rowing team and won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the men's 8+ event.[284]Robert Frost, poetDr. Seuss, writer and illustratorHenry Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs and United States Secretary of the TreasuryTimothy Geithner, former United States Secretary of the TreasurySalmon Chase, former Chief Justice of the U.S.Daniel Webster, former Secretary of StateNelson Rockefeller, former Vice President of the United StatesKirsten Gillibrand, American politicianRobert Reich, political commentator, professor, and authorSarah Wayne Callies, actressMindy Kaling, actress and comedianConnie Britton, actress, singer and producerShonda Rhimes, television producer and writerBrad Ausmus, baseball playerJake Tapper, journalist, author, and commentatorDartmouth College has appeared in or been referenced by a number of popular media.

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is the ninth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7] Although founded as a school to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, Dartmouth primarily trained Congregationalist ministers throughout its early history. The university gradually secularized, and by the turn of the 20th century rose from relative obscurity into national prominence as one of the top centers of higher education.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14]Following a liberal arts curriculum, the university provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 57 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[15] Dartmouth comprises five constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[16] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, the Rockefeller Institute for Public Policy, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,400, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions is highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of 8.7% for the Class of 2022.[17]Situated on a hill above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[18] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[19] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, strong Greek culture, and wide array of enduring campus traditions.[20][21][22] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I.Dartmouth is consistently included among the highest-ranked universities in the United States by several institutional rankings,[23] and has been cited as a leading university for undergraduate teaching and research by U.S. News & World Report.[24][25] In 2018, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education listed Dartmouth as the only 'majority-undergraduate,' 'arts-and-sciences focused,' 'doctoral university' in the country that has 'some graduate coexistence' and 'very high research activity.'[26] In a New York Times corporate study, Dartmouth graduates were shown to be among the most sought-after and valued in the world.[27]The university has produced many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives,[28] 24 U.S. governors, 10 billionaire alumni,[29] 10 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 79 Rhodes Scholars,[30] 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients,[31] 13 Pulitzer Prize winners, and numerous MacArthur Genius fellows,[32] Fulbright Scholars,[33] CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 corporations, high-ranking U.S. diplomats, scholars in academia, literary and media figures, professional athletes, and Olympic medalists.Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister from Columbia, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.[8]Wheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.[34] The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by Dr. John Phillips in 1762, who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.[8] The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the College. That charter created a college 'for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others.' The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth—an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it—Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.[9] The College granted its first degrees in 1771.[10]Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.[8][35] Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.[8][35]In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college'  charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[8] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: 'It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.'[8]In 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.[37]Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[11] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[38] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having 'refounded Dartmouth' and bringing it into national prestige.[39] Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[11] In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university.[40][41] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[11][42] During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.[43]In 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth.[44] Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[45] At about the same time, the college adopted its 'Dartmouth Plan' of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[44] In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from 'Men of Dartmouth' to 'Dear old Dartmouth'.[46]During the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed.[11][47] The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008.[48][49] The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center.[50] In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance 'whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial,' citing Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.[12]Since the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict.[51] President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008[52] and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009.[53]In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).[54]Dartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book Passion for Skiing as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book Passion for Snow.[55]Dartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students.[7][56] The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.[57] For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history.[58] The Government Department, whose prominent professors include Stephen Brooks, Richard Ned Lebow, and William Wohlforth, was ranked the top solely undergraduate political science program in the world by researchers at the London School of Economics in 2003.[59] The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew Samwick, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world.[60]In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.[61] Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten 'distributive requirements' in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.[61] Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in 'independent, sustained work,' culminating in the production of a thesis.[61] In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.[62][63]Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s.[7] Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of 'Dartmouth University';[7] however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward), the school uses the name 'Dartmouth College' to refer to the entire institution.[8]Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities.[7] Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.[64]Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern University, Tufts University and the University of Vermont.[65]USNWR graduate school rankings[74]USNWR departmental rankings[74]Dartmouth was ranked 11th among undergraduate programs at national universities by U.S. News & World Report in its 2018 rankings. Dartmouth's strength in undergraduate education is highlighted by U.S. News when in 2009 through 2013 it ranked Dartmouth first in undergraduate teaching at national universities. It was ranked 2nd in this area in the 2018 rankings. The institution also ranked 5th in High School Counselor Rankings in 2018. The college ranks 7th in The Wall Street Journal's ranking of top feeder schools.[75]The 2017 Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked Dartmouth among the 71-99th best universities in the nation, alongside institution such as Georgetown University and University of Notre Dame.[76] AWRU ranks Dartmouth among the 76–100 best schools in the world for Business Administration and 101–150 for Management and Psychology.In Forbes' 2016 rankings of colleges, Dartmouth ranked 17th overall in the combined liberal arts college and national universities ranking and 2nd in 'grateful graduates', with a financial grade of A+.[77]The 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only 'majority-undergraduate', 'arts-and-sciences focus[ed]', 'research university' in the country that also had 'some graduate coexistence' and 'very high research activity.'[78][79][80]For its graduate programs, U.S. News ranks Dartmouth's MBA program 9th overall and 6th for management. Among its other highly ranked graduate offerings, the school is ranked 40th in computer science, 29th in medicine for primary care, and 37th in medicine for research. Its global ranking places is at 242nd.[81]Undergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and U.S. News & World Report as 'most selective.'[85][86] The Princeton Review, in its 2018 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 98 out of 99.[87]For the freshman class entering Fall 2018, Dartmouth received 22,033 applications of which 1,925 were accepted for an 8.7% admissions rate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, a record 46.3% were valedictorian or salutatorian, with 97% ranking in the top decile of their class. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1497, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33. More than 51% identified as being students of color, 15% are among the first generation in their families to matriculate to college, 11% are international students, and 9% are legacies.[17]Additionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85.[82] Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, with the exception of internationals, on a need-blind basis.[88]Dartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth practices need-blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. For international students, financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $100,000 or less and possessing typical assets. In 2015, $88.8 million in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply 'D-Plan') is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[89] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman, senior, or sophomore summer terms.[90]  During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[89] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[91]The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as 'a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds.'[11] Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president (ex officio), the state governor (ex officio), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called 'charter trustees'), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board ('alumni trustees').[92] The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.Although the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,[93] the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.[94] In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.[95][96] In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.[97]—U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953[98]Dartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its 269-acre (1.09 km2) campus is centered on a 5-acre (2 ha) 'Green',[99] a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771.[100] Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,[101] and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.[102] In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500 acres (18 km2) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains[103] and a 27,000-acre (110 km2) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.[104]Dartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006.[105][106] Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style,[107][108][109] a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions.[110] The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.[111][112]A notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms.[113][114]The college's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts ('the Hop'). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty.[115] The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.[116] Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium.[115] The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes ('Hinman boxes')[117] and the Courtyard Café dining facility.[118] The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation,[119] and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.[120]In addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus[121] and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library.[122] The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School.[123] The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River.[122] The Thayer School comprises two buildings;[122] Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas.[124] The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library.[124]Dartmouth's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs.[7][125] Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business & Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Kresge Physical Sciences Library, Paddock Music Library, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002).[126] Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's 200-foot (61 m) tower is an iconic symbol of the College.[127][128][129]Dartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century.[100] Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.[130] The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a state of the art fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track.[131] Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.[132] Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.[133] The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.[134] Also visible from Memorial Field is the 91,800-square-foot (8,530 m2) Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.Dartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899),[135] and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse.[136] The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a 100-acre (0.40 km2) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire,[137] that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.Beginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities.[138] Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges.[139] The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.[139] Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.[140] More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.[139]Campus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus.[141] Four of them are located at the center of campus in the Class of 1953 Commons, formerly Thayer Dining Hall.[142]The Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the 'student union' or 'campus center.'[143] It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Centre.[144][145] Robinson Hall, next door to both Collis and Thayer, contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the Dartmouth Outing Club and The Dartmouth daily newspaper.[146]Lord Hall, Allen HouseMorton Hall, East Wheelock HouseWoodward Hall, North Park HouseMid Massachusetts Hall, School HouseTopliff Hall, South HouseRussell Sage Hall, West HouseCutter-Shabazz House for Intellectual InquiryIn 2006, The Princeton Review ranked Dartmouth third in its 'Quality of Life' category, and sixth for having the 'Happiest Students.'[147] Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities.[20] In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports.[148] The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in 'The Princeton Review' in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.[149]In 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in 'total of reports of rape' on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape. The Washington Post attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.[150] In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth College had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a 'sexually violent or harassing manner,' compared to 45.5% of students nationally.Dartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[151][152]Dartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests.[153] In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 'issue-oriented' groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups.[154] Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club,[155] which includes the nationally recognized[156] Big Green Bus; the campus's oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review;[157] and The Dartmouth, arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper.[158] The Dartmouth describes itself as 'America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799.'[158]Partially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students.[20][159] Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations.[160] In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization;[161] since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year.[162] Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s.[163] In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become 'substantially coeducational';[164] this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.[165] The fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[151][152]Dartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.[166]The college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.[167]Approximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics.[168] In 2007, Dartmouth College fielded 34 intercollegiate varsity teams: 16 for men, 16 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).[169] As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships.[169][170] In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.[7]The college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.[7][171] The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014.[172] The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2015.[173] The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008.[174] In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a 50-yard (46 m) swim and three terms of physical education.[175]It is often pointed out that the charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Eleazar Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created 'for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others.'[176] However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate White youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education.  The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.[177]The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years.[177] In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a 'new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment.'[177] Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.[177]Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions.[178] The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as 'big weekends'[179][180] or 'party weekends'.[181] In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class.[182] Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges.[183][184] In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.[185]The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance.[186] The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.[187]Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run Dartmouth Outing Club trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge.[188] In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.Dartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is Vox clamantis in deserto. The Latin motto is literally translated as 'A calling voice in the wilderness',[189][190] but is more often rendered as 'A voice crying out in the wilderness'.[1] The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.[190][191] Richard Hovey's 'Men of Dartmouth' was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,[182] and became the school's official song in 1926.[192] The song was retitled to 'Alma Mater' in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.[193]Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas.[176] The college's founder Eleazar Wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.[190] Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words 'vox clamantis in deserto' the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.[194]On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.[190] The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from '1770' to '1769', to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of '1769' to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.[190] The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.[195]On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a 'Dartmouth College Shield' for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from '1770' to '1769' around 1958.[190] That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.[195]College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.[196] The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of Dartmouth Medical School, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.[197] The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.Dartmouth has never had an official mascot.[198] The nickname 'The Big Green,'[199] originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green ('Dartmouth Green') as the school's official color in 1866.[200][201] Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname 'the Indians', a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.[198] This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the 'use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education.'[202] Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, The Dartmouth Review, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,[203] but never succeeded in doing so.[204]Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become 'official.' One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,[205] the mascot has received approval from only the student government.[206] In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the 'Dartmoose' as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.[207]Dartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the college.[208] Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in The Wall Street Journal based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.[209]By 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students and has over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields.[210]Nelson A. Rockefeller, 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York, graduated cum laude from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930. Over 164 Dartmouth graduates have served in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives,[211] such as Massachusetts statesman Daniel Webster.[211] Cabinet members of American presidents include Attorney General Amos T. Akerman,[212] Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich,[213] former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, and former Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. C. Everett Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States under President Ronald Reagan.[214] Two Dartmouth alumni have served as justices on the Supreme Court of the United States: Salmon P. Chase and Levi Woodbury.[215][216] Eugene Norman Veasey (class of 1954) served as the Chief Justice of Delaware. The 46th and current Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf,[217] and the 42nd and current Governor of Illinois, businessman Bruce Rauner,[218] are also Dartmouth alumni.In literature and journalism, Dartmouth has produced thirteen Pulitzer Prize winners: Thomas M. Burton,[219] Richard Eberhart,[220] Dan Fagin,[221] Paul Gigot, Frank Gilroy, Jake Hooker,[222] Nigel Jaquiss,[223] Joseph Rago,[224] Martin J. Sherwin,[225] David K. Shipler,[226] David Shribman, and Justin Harvey Smith.Other authors and media personalities include ABC Senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper, novelist and founding editor of The Believer Heidi Julavits, 'Dean of rock critics' Robert Christgau, National Book Award winners Louise Erdrich and Phil Klay, novelist/screenwriter Budd Schulberg,[227] political analyst Dinesh D'Souza,[228] radio talk show host Laura Ingraham,[229] commentator Mort Kondracke,[230] and journalist James Panero.[231] Norman Maclean, a former professor at the University of Chicago[232] and author of A River Runs Through It and Other Stories, graduated from Dartmouth in 1924.[233] Theodor Geisel, better known as children's author Dr. Seuss, was a member of the class of 1925.[234]In the area of religion and theology, Dartmouth alumni include priests and ministers Ebenezer Porter, Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, Caleb Sprague Henry, Arthur Whipple Jenks, Solomon Spalding, and Joseph Tracy; and rabbis Marshall Meyer, Arnold Resnicoff, and David E. Stern.[235][236][237][238][239] Hyrum Smith, brother of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, attended the college in his teens. He was Patriarch of the LDS Church.Dartmouth alumni in academia include Stuart Kauffman and Jeffrey Weeks, both recipients of MacArthur Fellowships (commonly called 'genius grants').[240][241] Dartmouth has also graduated three Nobel Prize winners: Owen Chamberlain (Physics, 1959),[242] K. Barry Sharpless (Chemistry, 2001),[243] and George Davis Snell (Physiology or Medicine, 1980).[244] Educators include founder and first president of Bates College, Oren Burbank Cheney (1839),[245] the current chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, Marye Anne Fox (PhD. in Chemistry, 1974),[246] founding president of Vassar College Milo Parker Jewett,[247] founder and first president of Kenyon College Philander Chase,[248] first professor of Wabash College Caleb Mills,[249] and former president of Union College Charles Augustus Aiken.[250][251] Nine of Dartmouth's 17 presidents were alumni of the College.[252]Dartmouth alumni serving as CEOs or company presidents and executives include Charles Alfred Pillsbury, founder of the Pillsbury Company and patriarch of the Pillsbury family, Sandy Alderson (San Diego Padres),[253] John Donahoe (eBay), Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. (IBM),[254] Charles E. Haldeman (Putnam Investments),[255] Donald J. Hall, Sr. (Hallmark Cards),[256] Jeffrey R.

content = The Mohegan are an American Indian people historically based in present-day Connecticut; the majority are associated with the Mohegan Indian Tribe, a federally recognized tribe living on a reservation in the eastern upper Thames River valley of south-central Connecticut.[1] It is one of two federally recognized tribes in the state, the other being the Mashantucket Pequot whose reservation is in Ledyard, Connecticut. There are also three state-recognized tribes: Schaghticoke, Paugusett, and Eastern Pequot.At the time of European contact, the Mohegan and Pequot were a unified tribal entity living in the southeastern Connecticut region, but the Mohegan gradually became independent as the hegemonic Pequot lost control over their trading empire and tributary groups. The name Pequot was given to the Mohegan by other tribes throughout the northeast and was eventually adopted by themselves. In 1637, English Puritan colonists destroyed a principal fortified village at Mistick with the help of Uncas, Wequash, and the Narragansetts during the Pequot War. This ended with the death of Uncas' cousin Sassacus at the hands of the Mohawk, an Iroquois Confederacy nation from west of the Hudson River. Thereafter, the Mohegan became a separate tribal nation under the leadership of their sachem Uncas.[1][2] Uncas is a variant anglicized spelling of the Algonquian name Wonkus, which translates to 'fox' in English. The word Mohegan (pronounced /ˈmoʊhiːɡæn/) translates in their respective Algonquin dialects (Mohegan-Pequot language) as 'People of the Wolf'.[3][4]Over time, the Mohegan gradually lost ownership of much of their tribal lands. In 1978, Chief Rolling Cloud Hamilton petitioned for federal recognition of the Mohegan. Descendants of his Mohegan band operate independently of the federally recognized nation.In 1994, a majority group of Mohegan gained federal recognition as the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut (MTIC).[5] They have been defined by the United States government as the 'successor in interest to the aboriginal entity known as the Mohegan Indian Tribe.'[6] The United States took land into trust the same year, under an act of Congress to serve as a reservation for the tribe. Most of the Mohegan people in Connecticut today live on the Mohegan Reservation at 41°28′42″N 72°04′55″W﻿ / ﻿41.47833°N 72.08194°W﻿ / 41.47833; -72.08194 near Uncasville in the Town of Montville, New London County. The MTIC operate one of two Mohegan Sun Casinos on their reservation in Uncasville.The Mohegan Indian Tribe was historically based in central southern Connecticut, originally part of the Pequot people. It gradually became independent and served as allies of English colonists in the Pequot War of 1636, which broke the power of the formerly dominant Pequot tribe in the region. In reward, the Colonists gave Pequot captives to the Mohegan tribe.The Mohegan homelands in Connecticut include landmarks such as Trading Cove on the Thames River, Cochegan Rock, Fort Shantok, and Mohegan Hill, where the Mohegan founded a Congregational church in the early 1800s. In 1931, the Tantaquidgeon family built the Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum on Mohegan Hill to house tribal artifacts and histories. Gladys Tantaquidgeon (1899-2005) served for years as the Tribe's medicine woman and unofficial historian. She studied anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania and worked for a decade with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Returning to Connecticut, she operated this museum for six decades.[7] It was one of the first museums to be owned and operated by American Indians.[8]In 1933, John E. Hamilton[9][10] (Chief Rolling Cloud) was appointed as a Grand Sachem by his mother Alice Storey through a traditional selection process based on heredity.  She was a direct descendant of Uncas and of Tamaquashad, Sachem of the Pequot tribe. In Mohegan tradition, the position of tribal leadership was often hereditary through the maternal line.In the 1960s, during a period of rising activism among Native Americans, John Hamilton filed a number of land claims authorized by the 'Council of Descendants of Mohegan Indians.' The group had some 300 members at the time. In 1970 the Montville band of Mohegans expressed its dissatisfaction with land-claims litigation. When the Hamilton supporters left the meeting, this band elected Courtland Fowler as their new leader. Notes of that Council meeting referred to Hamilton as Sachem.[11]The group led by John Hamilton (although opposed by the Fowlers) worked with the attorney Jerome Griner in federal land claims through the 1970s. During this time, a Kent, Connecticut property owners' organization, with some Native and non-Native members, worked to oppose the Hamilton land claims and the recognition petition for federal recognition, out of fear that tribal nations would take private properties. In 1978, in response to the desires of tribal nations across the country to gain federal recognition and recover tribal sovereignty, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) established a formal administrative process. The process included specific criteria that BIA officials would judge as evidence of cultural continuity. In that same year, Hamilton's band submitted a petition for federal recognition for the Mohegan tribe.The petition process stalled when John Hamilton died in 1988. The petition for federal recognition was revived in 1989, but the BIA's preliminary finding was that the Mohegan had not satisfied the criteria of documenting continuity in social community, and political authority and influence as a tribe through the twentieth century.In 1990, the Mohegan band led by Chief Courtland Fowler submitted a detailed response to meet the BIA's concerns. The tribe included compiled genealogies and other records, including records pertaining to the Mohegan Congregational Church in Montville. BIA researchers used records provided by the Hamilton band, records from the Mohegan Church, and records maintained by Gladys Tantaquidgeon, who had kept genealogy and vital statistics of tribal members for her anthropological research.[7][12]In 1990, the Fowler group, identifying as the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut (MTIC), decided that the tribe's membership would be restricted to documented descendants from a single family group, ca. 1860. This criteria excludes some of the Hamilton followers. By law, a Federally recognized tribe has the authority to determine its own rules for membership. The MTIC unsuccessfully attempted to stop other Mohegan people from using 'Mohegan' as their tribal identity, in public records and in craftwork.[13]In its 1994 'Final Determination,' the BIA cited the vital statistics and genealogies as documents that were decisive in demonstrating 'that the tribe did indeed have social and political continuity during the middle of the 20th century.'[14] As a result, the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut (MTIC) gained recognition as a sovereign tribal nation.That same year, Congress passed the Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act, which authorized the United States to take land into trust to establish a reservation for the Mohegan and settle their land claim. The final 1994 agreement between MTIC and the State in the settlement of land claims extinguished all pending land claims.[14] The MTIC adopted a written constitution. MTIC is governed by a chief, an elected chairman and an elected tribal council, all of whom serve for specific terms.The Mohegan people associated with Sachem John Hamilton persist as an independent group today. In his will, Hamilton named his non-Mohegan wife, Eleanor Fortin as Sachem. She is now the leader of the 'Hamilton group.' Despite their contentious histories and disagreements, both groups continued to participate in tribal activities and to identify as members of the Mohegan people. The Hamilton band of Mohegans continues to function and govern themselves independently of the MTIC, holding periodic gatherings and activities in their traditional territory of south central Connecticut.The last living native speaker of the Mohegan language, Fidelia 'Flying Bird' A. Hoscott Fielding, died in 1908. The Mohegan language was recorded primarily in her diaries, and in articles and a Smithsonian Institution report made by the early anthropologist, Frank Speck.[15][16]  Her niece, Gladys Tantaquidgeon, worked to preserve the language.[7] Since 2012, the Mohegan Tribe has established a project to revive its language and establish new generations of native speakers.The Mohegan people have always had extensive knowledge of local flora and fauna, of hunting and fishing technologies, of seasonal adaptations, and of herbal medicine, as practices passed down through the generations. Gladys Tantaquidgeon was instrumental in recording herbal medicinal knowledge and folklore, and in comparing these plants and practices to those of other Algonquian peoples like the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) and Wampanoag,For example, an infusion of bark removed from the south side of the silver maple tree is used by the Mohegan for cough medicine.[17] The Mohegan also use the inner bark of the sugar maple as a cough remedy, and the sap as a sweetening agent and to make maple syrup.[18]Although similar in name, the Mohegan are a different tribe from the Mahican (also called the Stockbridge Mohican), who share similar Algonkian culture and constitute another branch in the Algonquian language family.  The Mahican were historically based along the upper Hudson River in present-day eastern New York and along the upper Housatonic River in western Massachusetts.  In the United States, both tribes have been referred to in various historic documents by the spelling 'Mohican', based on mistakes in translation and location.[19] But, the Dutch colonist Adriaen Block, one of the first Europeans to record the names of both tribes, clearly distinguished between the 'Morhicans' (now the Mohegans) and the 'Mahicans, Mahikanders, Mohicans, [or] Maikens'.[19][20]In 1735, Housatonic Mahican leaders negotiated with Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher to found the town of  Stockbridge, Massachusetts, just to the west of the Berkshire Mountains, as a mission village. After the American Revolution, these Mahican people, along with New York Mahicans, relocated to live at a new Stockbridge, alongside the Oneida in central New York. During the 1820s the majority of these people removed further west, eventually settling in Wisconsin, where today they constitute the Stockbridge Munsee Band of Mohican Indians. These removals inspired the myth of the 'Last of the Mohicans.'[citation needed]Most of the descendants of the Mohegan tribe, by contrast, have continued to live in New England, and particularly in Connecticut, since the colonial era.

content = An anthropologist is a person engaged in the practice of anthropology. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies.[1][2][3] Social anthropology, cultural anthropology, and philosophical anthropology study the norms and values of societies.

title   = International Standard Serial Number
url     = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number
content = An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an eight-digit serial number used to uniquely identify a serial publication.[1] The ISSN is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title. ISSN are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.[2]The ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975.[3] ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for maintaining the standard.When a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in print and electronic media. The ISSN system refers to these types as print ISSN (p-ISSN) and electronic ISSN (e-ISSN), respectively.[4] Conversely, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a linking ISSN (ISSN-L), typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium.[5]The format of the ISSN is an eight digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.[1] As an integer number, it can be represented by the first seven digits.[6] The last code digit, which may be 0-9 or an X, is a check digit. Formally, the general form of the ISSN code (also named 'ISSN structure' or 'ISSN syntax')  can be expressed as follows:[7]or by a Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) regular expression:[8]The ISSN of the journal Hearing Research, for example, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that is C=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used:To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right (if the check digit is X, then add 10 to the sum). The modulus 11 of the sum must be 0.There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm.[9][10]ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre based in Paris. The International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government. The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the ISDS Register (International Serials Data System) otherwise known as the ISSN Register. At the end of 2016,[update] the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items.[11]ISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept, where ISBNs are assigned to individual books. An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no information as to the publisher or its location. For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change.Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial a new identifier, the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI), was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components (like the table of contents).Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media (except reproduction microforms). Thus, the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs.[12] Also, a CD-ROM version and a web version of a serial require different ISSNs since two different media are involved. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats (e.g. PDF and HTML) of the same online serial.This 'media-oriented identification' of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, and the Web, it makes sense to consider only content, independent of media. This 'content-oriented identification' of serials was a repressed demand during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials' contents model arrived with the indecs Content Model and its application, the digital object identifier (DOI), as ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s.Only later, in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the new ISSN standard (ISO 3297:2007) as an 'ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media'.[13]The ISSN Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web, but is available by subscription. There are several routes to the identification and verification of ISSN codes for the public:An ISSN can be encoded as a uniform resource name (URN) by prefixing it with 'urn:ISSN:'.[14] For example, Rail could be referred to as 'urn:ISSN:0953-4563'. URN namespaces are case-sensitive, and the ISSN namespace is all caps.[15] If the checksum digit is 'X' then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN.The util URNs are content-oriented, but ISSN is media-oriented:A unique URN for serials simplifies the search, recovery and delivery of data for various services including, in particular, search systems and knowledge databases.[13] ISSN-L (see Linking ISSN below) was created to fill this gap.There are two most popular media types that adopted special labels (indicating below in italics), and one in fact ISSN-variant, with also an optional label. All are used in standard metadata context like JATS, and the labels also, frequently, as abbreviations.p-ISSN is a standard label for 'Print ISSN', the ISSN for the print media (paper) version of a serial. Usually it is the 'default media', so the 'default ISSN'.e-ISSN (or eISSN) is a standard label for 'Electronic ISSN', the ISSN for the electronic media (online) version of a serial.ISSN-L is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media. As defined by ISO 3297:2007, the 'linking ISSN (ISSN-L)'  provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource.The ISSN-L is one ISSN number among the existing ISSNs, so, does not change the use or assignment of 'ordinary' ISSNs;[17] it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication. If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time, the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of the ISSN-L.With ISSN-L is possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title. The use of ISSN-L facilitates search, retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like OpenURL, library catalogues, search engines or knowledge bases.[18]

title   = Equal-loudness contour
url     = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour
content = An equal-loudness contour is a measure of sound pressure (dB SPL), over the frequency spectrum, for which a listener perceives a constant loudness when presented with pure steady tones. The unit of measurement for loudness levels is the phon, and is arrived at by reference to equal-loudness contours. By definition, two sine waves of differing frequencies are said to have equal-loudness level measured in phons if they are perceived as equally loud by the average young person without significant hearing impairment.Equal-loudness contours are often referred to as 'Fletcher-Munson' curves, after the earliest researchers, but those studies have been superseded and incorporated into newer standards. The definitive curves are those defined in the international standard ISO 226:2003, which are based on a review of modern determinations made in various countries.The human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from about 20 Hz to a maximum of around 22,000 Hz, although the upper hearing limit decreases with age. Within this range, the human ear is most sensitive between 2 and 5 kHz, largely due to the resonance of the ear canal and the transfer function of the ossicles of the middle ear.Fletcher and Munson first measured equal-loudness contours using headphones (1933). In their study, test subjects listened to pure tones at various frequencies and over 10 dB increments in stimulus intensity. For each frequency and intensity, the listener also listened to a reference tone at 1000 Hz. Fletcher and Munson adjusted the reference tone until the listener perceived that it was the same loudness as the test tone. Loudness, being a psychological quantity, is difficult to measure, so Fletcher and Munson averaged their results over many test subjects to derive reasonable averages. The lowest equal-loudness contour represents the quietest audible tone—the absolute threshold of hearing. The highest contour is the threshold of pain.Churcher and King carried out a second determination in 1937, but their results and Fletcher and Munson's showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram.[1]In 1956 Robinson and Dadson produced a new experimental determination that they believed was more accurate. It became the basis for a standard (ISO 226) that was considered definitive until 2003, when ISO revised the standard on the basis of recent assessments by research groups worldwide.Perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations led the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to revise the standard curves in ISO 226. They did this in response to recommendations in a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies—by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher-Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15 dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons not explained.[2]Equal-loudness curves derived using headphones are valid only for the special case of what is called side-presentation, which is not how we normally hear. Real-life sounds arrive as planar wavefronts, if from a reasonably distant source. If the source of sound is directly in front of the listener, then both ears receive equal intensity, but at frequencies above about 1 kHz the sound that enters the ear canal is partially reduced by the masking effect of the head, and also highly dependent on reflection off the pinna (outer ear). Off-centre sounds result in increased head masking at one ear, and subtle changes in the effect of the pinna, especially at the other ear. This combined effect of head-masking and pinna reflection is quantified in a set of curves in three-dimensional space referred to as head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Frontal presentation is now regarded as preferable when deriving equal-loudness contours, and the latest ISO standard is specifically based on frontal and central presentation.The Robinson-Dadson determination used loudspeakers, and for a long time the difference from the Fletcher-Munson curves was explained partly on the basis that the latter used headphones. However, the ISO report actually lists the latter as using 'compensated' headphones, though it doesn't make clear how Robinson-Dadson achieved 'compensation'.Good headphones, well sealed to the ear, provide a flat low-frequency pressure response to the ear canal, with low distortion even at high intensities. At low frequencies the ear is purely pressure-sensitive, and the cavity formed between headphones and ear is too small to introduce modifying resonances. Headphone testing is therefore a good way to derive equal-loudness contours below about 500 Hz, though reservations have been expressed about the validity of headphone measurements when determining the actual threshold of hearing, based on observation that closing off the ear canal produces increased sensitivity to the sound of blood flow within the ear, which the brain appears to mask in normal listening conditions[citation needed]. At high frequencies, headphone measurement gets unreliable, and the various resonances of pinnae (outer ears) and ear canals are severely affected by proximity to the headphone cavity.With speakers, the opposite is true. A flat low-frequency response is hard to obtain—except in free space high above ground, or in a very large and anechoic chamber that is free from reflections down to 20 Hz. Until recently,[when?] it was not possible to achieve high levels at frequencies down to 20 Hz without high levels of harmonic distortion. Even today, the best speakers are likely to generate around 1 to 3% of total harmonic distortion, corresponding to 30 to 40 dB below fundamental. This is not good enough, given the steep rise in loudness (rising to as much as 24 dB per octave) with frequency revealed by the equal-loudness curves below about 100 Hz. A good experimenter must ensure that trial subjects really hear the fundamental and not harmonics—especially the third harmonic, which is especially strong as a speaker cone's travel becomes limited as its suspension reaches the limit of compliance. A possible way around the problem is to use acoustic filtering, such as by resonant cavity, in the speaker setup. A flat free-field high-frequency response up to 20 kHz, on the other hand, is comparatively easy to achieve with modern speakers on-axis. These effects must be considered when comparing results of various attempts to measure equal-loudness contours.The A-weighting curve—in widespread use for noise measurement—is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve. However, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise.[3] This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyzes sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the signals to the brain add  the various bands to produce the impressions of loudness. For these reasons Equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1 kHz and a downward tilt below 1 kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.Various weighting curves were derived in the 1960s, in particular as part of the DIN 4550 standard for audio quality measurement, which differed from the A-weighting curve, showing more of a peak around 6 kHz. These gave a more meaningful subjective measure of noise on audio equipment, especially on the newly invented compact cassette tape recorders with Dolby noise reduction, which were characterised by a noise spectrum dominated by the higher frequencies.BBC Research conducted listening trials in an attempt to find the best weighting curve and rectifier combination for use when measuring noise in broadcast equipment, examining the various new weighting curves in the context of noise rather than tones, confirming that they were much more valid than A-weighting when attempting to measure the subjective loudness of noise. This work also investigated the response of human hearing to tone-bursts, clicks, pink noise and a variety of other sounds that, because of their brief impulsive nature, do not give the ear and brain sufficient time to respond. The results were reported in BBC Research Report EL-17 1968/8 entitled The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits.The ITU-R 468 noise weighting curve, originally proposed in CCIR recommendation 468, but later adopted by numerous standards bodies (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) was based on the research, and incorporates a special Quasi-peak detector to account for our reduced sensitivity to short bursts and clicks.[4] It is widely used by Broadcasters and audio professionals when they measure noise on broadcast paths and audio equipment, so they can subjectively compare equipment types with different noise spectra and characteristics.

The unit of measurement for loudness levels is the phon, and is arrived at by reference to equal-loudness contours. By definition, two sine waves of differing frequencies are said to have equal-loudness level measured in phons if they are perceived as equally loud by the average young person without significant hearing impairment.Equal-loudness contours are often referred to as 'Fletcher-Munson' curves, after the earliest researchers, but those studies have been superseded and incorporated into newer standards. The definitive curves are those defined in the international standard ISO 226:2003, which are based on a review of modern determinations made in various countries.The human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from about 20 Hz to a maximum of around 22,000 Hz, although the upper hearing limit decreases with age. Within this range, the human ear is most sensitive between 2 and 5 kHz, largely due to the resonance of the ear canal and the transfer function of the ossicles of the middle ear.Fletcher and Munson first measured equal-loudness contours using headphones (1933). In their study, test subjects listened to pure tones at various frequencies and over 10 dB increments in stimulus intensity. For each frequency and intensity, the listener also listened to a reference tone at 1000 Hz. Fletcher and Munson adjusted the reference tone until the listener perceived that it was the same loudness as the test tone. Loudness, being a psychological quantity, is difficult to measure, so Fletcher and Munson averaged their results over many test subjects to derive reasonable averages. The lowest equal-loudness contour represents the quietest audible tone—the absolute threshold of hearing. The highest contour is the threshold of pain.Churcher and King carried out a second determination in 1937, but their results and Fletcher and Munson's showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram.[1]In 1956 Robinson and Dadson produced a new experimental determination that they believed was more accurate. It became the basis for a standard (ISO 226) that was considered definitive until 2003, when ISO revised the standard on the basis of recent assessments by research groups worldwide.Perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations led the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to revise the standard curves in ISO 226. They did this in response to recommendations in a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies—by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher-Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15 dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons not explained.[2]Equal-loudness curves derived using headphones are valid only for the special case of what is called side-presentation, which is not how we normally hear. Real-life sounds arrive as planar wavefronts, if from a reasonably distant source. If the source of sound is directly in front of the listener, then both ears receive equal intensity, but at frequencies above about 1 kHz the sound that enters the ear canal is partially reduced by the masking effect of the head, and also highly dependent on reflection off the pinna (outer ear). Off-centre sounds result in increased head masking at one ear, and subtle changes in the effect of the pinna, especially at the other ear. This combined effect of head-masking and pinna reflection is quantified in a set of curves in three-dimensional space referred to as head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Frontal presentation is now regarded as preferable when deriving equal-loudness contours, and the latest ISO standard is specifically based on frontal and central presentation.The Robinson-Dadson determination used loudspeakers, and for a long time the difference from the Fletcher-Munson curves was explained partly on the basis that the latter used headphones. However, the ISO report actually lists the latter as using 'compensated' headphones, though it doesn't make clear how Robinson-Dadson achieved 'compensation'.Good headphones, well sealed to the ear, provide a flat low-frequency pressure response to the ear canal, with low distortion even at high intensities. At low frequencies the ear is purely pressure-sensitive, and the cavity formed between headphones and ear is too small to introduce modifying resonances. Headphone testing is therefore a good way to derive equal-loudness contours below about 500 Hz, though reservations have been expressed about the validity of headphone measurements when determining the actual threshold of hearing, based on observation that closing off the ear canal produces increased sensitivity to the sound of blood flow within the ear, which the brain appears to mask in normal listening conditions[citation needed]. At high frequencies, headphone measurement gets unreliable, and the various resonances of pinnae (outer ears) and ear canals are severely affected by proximity to the headphone cavity.With speakers, the opposite is true. A flat low-frequency response is hard to obtain—except in free space high above ground, or in a very large and anechoic chamber that is free from reflections down to 20 Hz. Until recently,[when?] it was not possible to achieve high levels at frequencies down to 20 Hz without high levels of harmonic distortion. Even today, the best speakers are likely to generate around 1 to 3% of total harmonic distortion, corresponding to 30 to 40 dB below fundamental. This is not good enough, given the steep rise in loudness (rising to as much as 24 dB per octave) with frequency revealed by the equal-loudness curves below about 100 Hz. A good experimenter must ensure that trial subjects really hear the fundamental and not harmonics—especially the third harmonic, which is especially strong as a speaker cone's travel becomes limited as its suspension reaches the limit of compliance. A possible way around the problem is to use acoustic filtering, such as by resonant cavity, in the speaker setup. A flat free-field high-frequency response up to 20 kHz, on the other hand, is comparatively easy to achieve with modern speakers on-axis. These effects must be considered when comparing results of various attempts to measure equal-loudness contours.The A-weighting curve—in widespread use for noise measurement—is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve.

It is a natural extension of ISO 704.The standard addresses two types of harmonization: concept harmonization and term harmonization. Concept harmonization means the reduction or elimination of minor differences between two or more closely related concepts. Concept harmonization is not the transfer of a concept system to another language. It involves the comparison and matching of concepts and concept systems in one or more languages or subject fields.Term harmonization refers to the designation of a single concept (in different languages) by terms that reflect similar characteristics or similar forms. Term harmonization is possible only when the concepts the terms represent are almost exactly the same. The standard contains a flow chart for the harmonization process and a description of the procedures for performing it.ISO 860:2007 specifies a methodological approach to the harmonization of concepts, concept systems, definitions and terms. It applies to the development of harmonized terminologies, at either the national or international level, in either a monolingual or a multilingual context. It replaces: ISO 860:1996
